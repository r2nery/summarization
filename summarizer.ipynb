      "W.A. Lewis: Classical economists assumed that an unlimited supply of labour was available at subsistence wages. They found the answer in capital accumulation, which they explained in terms of their analysis of the distribution of income. In the neo-classical era, labour ceased to be unlimited in supply, and the formal model of economic analysis was no longer expected to explain the expansion of the system through time. The purpose of this essay is to see what can be made of the classical framework in solving problems of distribution, accumulation, and growth, first in a closed and then in an open economy. We are not arguing, let it be repeated, that this assumption should be made for all areas of the world. It is obviously not true of the United Kingdom, or of North West Europe. But on the other hand it is obviously relevant assumption for the economies of Egypt, of India, and of Jamaica. We will not spend time on individual writers, enquiring what they meant, or assessing its validity or truth. Our purpose is rather to bring their framework up-to-date, in the light of modern knowledge, and to see how far it then helps us to understand the contemporary problems of large area of the earth. In place of labour may be said to exist in those countries where the population is so large, that there is the economy where the productivity of labour is negligible, or even negative. Several writers have drawn attention to the existence of such “guised unemployment” in the agricultural sector, demonstrating in each case that the family holding on is so small that if some members of the family obtained other employment the remaining remaining employment is so. small that the. remaining unemployment is small that it is not even small enough to be ‘guised’ in the case of agricultural sector. We have to begin by elaborating the assumption of an unlimitedSupplies of labour, and by establishing that it was a useful assumption in the classical era. It was thought at first that this was the .book which would illuminate the problems of countries with surplus labour. But Keynesianism is only a footnote to neoclassicism- albeit a long, important and fascinating footnote. The student of such economies has therefore to work right back to the classical economists before he finds an analytical framework into which he can relevantly fit his problems. The goal is to elaborate a different framework for those countries which the neoclassical (and Keynesian) assumptions do not fit. The aim is \n",
      " In over-populated countries the code of ethical behaviour so shapes itself that it becomes good form for each person to offer as much employment as he can. The price of labour, in these economies, is a wage at the subsistence level (we define this later) The supply of labour is therefore “unlimited” so long as the supply of Labour at this price exceeds the demand. In this situation, new industries can be created, or old industries expanded without, limit at the existing wage. There are, however, a number of countries where the current limit is for practical purposes only employment opportunities. For example, in 1939 there were 52 women gainfully employed for every 100 men in the U.K. in 1939. In South Wales, there were only 15 women gainful employed forevery 100 men. In the Gold Coast, although there is an acute shortage of male labour, any industry which offered employment to women would be a good good. -The line between employees and dependents is very thinly drawn. This is found not only in domestic service, but in every sector of employment. Most businesses in, under-developed countries employ a large number of “messengers,” whose contribution is almost negligible ; you see them sitting outside office doors, or hanging around in the courtyard. And even in the severest slump the agricultural or commercial employer is expected to keep his labour force somehow or other-it would be immoral to turn them out, for how would they eat, in countries where only form of unemployment assistance is the charity of relatives. So it comes about that even  2 per cent marginal productivity may be negligible or even zero. If we cease to ask whether the marginal productivity of labour. is negligible and ask instead only the question from what sectors would additional labour be available if new industries were created offering employment at subsistence wages, the answer becomes even more comprehensive. For we have then not only the farmers, the casuals, the petty traders and the retainers (domestic and commercial), but we have also three other classes from which to choose. First of all, there are the wives and daughters of the household. The employment of women outside the household depends upon a great number of factors, religious and conventional, and is certainly not exclusively a matter of employment opportunities, as it is in many countries. For there were just 52 women in the United Kingdom in 1939 whereas there were every 100 women in Lancashire in 2009. There were only \n",
      " The transfer of women’s work from the household to commercial employment is one of the most notable features of economic development. One of the surest ways of increasing the national income is to create new sources of employment for women outside the home. The second source of labour for expanding industries is the increase in the population resulting from the excess of births and deaths. This source is important in any dynamic analysis of how capital accumulation can occur, and employment can increase, without any increase in real wages. The effect of capital accumulation in the past has been to reduce the size of the reserve army, and not to increase it, so we have lost interest in arguments about what is “theoretically” possible. Skilled labour may be the bottleneck in expansion of new industries or new employment opportunities without any shortage of unskilled labour becoming apparent in the labour market. There may at any time be a shortage of skilled workers of any grade-ranging from masons, electric welders to engineers, biologists or land administrators, just like capital is like a “quasi-bottleneck,” Marshall might have called it. We are not quite sure why the birth rate in Western Europe has fallen during the last eighty years, but we suspect that it was for reasons associated with development, and we hope that the same thing may happen in the rest of the world as development spreads. Of the 3    sources we have now listed-the farmers, the casuals, the petty traders, the retainers (domestic and commercial), women in the household, and population growth-it is clear enough that there can be in an over-populated economy an enormous expansion ofnew industries or employment opportunities. We know little. There is no evidence that the birth rates ever rises with economic development, but the effect of development on the death rate is so swift and certain. We can say for certain that the, immediate effect of economic. development is to cause the population to grow; after some decades it begins to grow (we hope) less rapidly. In any society with a death rate of around 40 per thousand, the effects of economicdevelopment will be to generate an increase in. the supply of labour. In the first stage because better communications and trade eliminate death from local famines ; in the second stage because public health facilities banish the great epidemic diseases of plague, smallpox, cholera, malaria, yellow fever (and eventually tuberculosis) ; and in the third \n",
      " If unlimited labour is available, while capital is scarce, we know from the Law of Variable Proportions that the capital should not be spread thinly over all the labour. In practice, however, labour is not available at a zero wage. Capital will therefore be applied only up to the point where the marginal productivity of labour equals the current wage. Workers outside this sector (i.e. beyond M) earn what they can in the subsistence sector of the economy. As more capital becomes available more workers can be draw into the capitalist sector, and their output per head rises as they move from the one sector to the other. What we have is not one island of expanding capitalist employment, surrounded by a vast sea of subsistence workers. But rather a number of such tiny islands. This is very typical of countries in their early stages of development. We find a few industries highly capitalised, such as mining or electric power. But a few high class shops surrounded by masses of old masses of peasants. There are one or two modern towns, with the finest life outside their economic life. But we find the same contrasts also in villages which might almost belong to another planet. There is the difference between the capitalised and the semi-capitalised. We can proceed on the assumption that so long as these are available the necessary skills will be provided as well, though perhaps with some time lag. 3. For it is only a very temporary bottleneck, in the sense that if the capital is available for development, the capitalists or their government will soon provide the facilities for training more skilled people. The real bottlenecks to expansion are therefore capital and natural resources. 4    We note the use of the terms “capitalist’ sector and “subsistence” sector. The capitalist sector is that part of the Economy which uses reproducible capital, and pays capitalists for the use thereof. This coincides with Smith’s definition of the productive workers, who are those who work with capital and whose product can therefore be sold at a price above their wages. 5   The distinction between productive and unproductive had nothing to do with whether the work yielded utility, as some neo-classicists have scornfully but erroneously asserted. It does not make any difference to the argument, and for convenience we will follow this usage for convenience. We will also take account of the fact that the capitalists’ surplus. WNP goes in wages to workers in the capitalistsector \n",
      " Capital and new ideas are not thinly diffused throughout the economy. They are highly concentrated at a number of points, from which they spread outwards. Capitalists have experience of certain types of investment, say of trading or plantation agriculture, and stick to what they know. In backward economies knowledge is one of the scarcest goods. The wage which the expanding capitalist sector has to, pay is determined by what people can earn outside that sector. The fact that the wage level in the capitalist sector depends upon earnings in the subsistence sector is sometimes of immense political importance. Inevitably what one gets are very heavily developed patches of the economy, surrounded by economic darkness. The failure of imperialism to improve African agriculture has been negligible. The imperialists invest capital and hire workers; it is to their advantage to keep wages low, and even in those cases where they do not actually go out of their way to impoverish the subsistence economy, they will at least very seldom be found doing anything to make it more productive. In actual fact the record of every imperialists in Africa in modern times is. one of impoverishing the subsistence. economy, either by taking away the people’s land, or by imposing forced labour on the capitalist. sector. Compared with what they have spent on providing. facilities for European agriculture or their expenditure on. mining, for example, the improvement of African agriculture for European. mining has been virtually non-existent. This is a fact of modern times, or modern times in capitalist times. In modern times modern times it is not even possible to make a profit from mining or other forms of industry. But in any case marginal. profits are not the same all round, and islands which yield diminishing returns may be more profitable than others, the earliest capitalists having cornered the vantage points. The minimum at which labour can be had is now set by the average product of the farmer. This objective standard, alas, disappears again if the farmers have to pay rent, and in overpopulated countries the rent will probably be adjusted so as to leave them just enough for a conventional level of subsistence. Whatever the mechanism, the result is an unlimited supply of labour for which this is the minimum level of earnings. It is not, however, of great importance to the argument whether earnings are determined objectively by the level of peasant productivity, or subjectively in terms of a conventional standard of living. In a very highly developed economy the tendency for capital to flow evenly through the economy \n",
      " There is usually a gap of 30 per cent. or more between capitalist wages and subsistence earnings. This gap may be explained in several ways. Part of the difference is illusory, because of the higher cost of living in the capitalist sector. The more efficient firm, instead of competing wherever its real costs are marginally less than its rivals, establishes for itself superior standards of remuneration. It pays its workers more and lavishes welfare services, scholarships and pensions upon them. It demands a higher rate on its marginal investments. It goes in for prestige expenditure, contributing to hospitals, universities, flood relief and such. Its highest executives spend their time sitting on public committees, and have to have deputies to do their work. When all this is taken into account it is not at all surprising to find a competitive equilibrium in which high cost firms survive easily side by side with firms of much greater efficiency. 4. So far we have merely been setting the stage. Now the play begins. For we can now begin to trace the process of economic expansion. The key to the process is the use which is make of the capitalist surplus in so far as this is reinvested in creating new capital. The surplus is then larger still, capital formation is still greater, and so the process continues until the labour surplus disappears. OS now represents subsistence earnings, and OW the capitalist wage (real not money). To borrow an analogy from the sea, the frontier of competition between capitalist and subsistence labour, now appears not as a beach but as a cliff. WNQ1 represents .. the initial stage. . . Since the initial surplus is the initial’s, the amount of fixed capital is now raised throughout the schedule of the marginal productivity of labour is raised to the level of N2Q1. . Hence some of this is now being reinvested to the raised level of marginal productivity. Both OS and OW now represent the level at which some of the fixed capital increases to the fixed level of the productivity of the labour force. W1Q1 is the level in which the initial capital increases, and since the initial labour surplus is. the capital surplus is now reinvested, this is the stage at which the capital is raised throughout. The capitalist sector expands, taking more people into capitalist employment out of the subsistence sector. This is called the ‘exploitation of labour’. It is not wholly to be attributed to self interest, but there are many places where it can be traced \n",
      " In theory it should be possible to distinguish between growth of capital and the growth of technical knowledge, but in practice it is neither possible nor necessary for this analysis. The application of new technical knowledge usually requires new investment, and whether the new knowledge is capital-saving (and thus equivalent to an increase in capital) or labour-saving makes no difference to our diagram. Next we must consider more closely the capitalist surplus. Malthus wanted to know what the capitalists would do with this ever-growing surplus; surely this would be an embarrassing glut of commodities? Ricardo replied that there would be no glut; since the supply of labour is unlimited, you can always find employment for any amount of capital. This is absolutely correct, for his model; in the neo-classical model capital grows faster than labour, and so one has to ask whether the rate of profit will not fall. The only fly in the ointment is that there may develop a shortage of natural resources, so that though the natural resources may develop so that the natural rate of capital growth may not be as fast as the capital/labour ratio, it may still be faster than it was in the past. The classical model means that the capital rate can be held constant for any quantity of surplus, in the unlimited quantity of labour. The unlimited rate of surplus means that there can be unlimited “widening” of the ‘widening of the Ointment’ in the capitalist sector (i.e. the surplus and capitalist employment are now larger. Further reinvestment raises the schedule of the marginal productivity of labour to N3Q3. And the process continues so long as there is surplus labour.  Various comments are needed in elaboration. First, as to the relationship between capital, technical progress, and productivity. In any case, for the purpose of this analysis it is unnecessary to ‘distinguish between capital formation and the growing of knowledge within the capitalist Sector’. Second, in economies where techniques are stagnant savings are not so readily applied to increasing productive capital. In such economies it is more usual to use savings for building pyramids, churches, and other such durable consumer goods. This means that in the next stage of employment the expansion of employment is not as big as it would have been if they had created more fixed capital and so brought more workers into the capitalistsector. This new fixed capital would then make possible the employment of more people in thecapitalist sector. \n",
      "  Marx’s interest in the surplus was ethical as well as scientific. He regarded it as robbery of the workers. The surplus, after all, is only partly consumed; the other part is used for capital formation. Even in the U.S.R. all these functionaries are paid out of the surplus, and handsomely paid too. It is arguable that these services are over-paid ; this is why we have pro gressive taxation, and it is also one of the more dubious arguments for nationalisation. We cannot explain any “industrial” revolution (as the economic historians pretend to do) until we can explain why saving increased relatively to national income. The important question is why does the top 10 per cent. save more ? The reason may be because they decide to consume less, but this does not square with the facts. There is no evidence of a fall in personal consumption by the top ten per cent at a time when they do not save any more, though they do spend less on durable goods (tombs, temples) and more on productive capital. If we assume technical progress in agriculture, no hoarding, and unlimited labour at a constant wage, the rate of profit on capital cannot fall. On the contrary it must increase. This is the central problem because the central fact of economic development is rapid capital accumulation. We are interested not in the people in general, but only say in the 10% of them with the largest incomes, who in countries with surplus labour receive up to 40 per cent of the national income (nearer 30 per cent in more developed countries). The remaining 90 per cent* of the* people never manage to save a significant fraction of their incomes. The reason for this is a striking difference in the disposition of civilisations in which there is a rapid growth of technical knowledge or skills with’ capital (including knowledge and skills with the capital’). It is possible that the explanation is simply that some psychological change occurs which causes people to be more thrifty. This, however, is not a plausible explanation. The central problem is to understand the process by which a community hich was previously saving and investing 4 or 5% of is national income or less, converts itself into an economy where voluntary saving is running at about 12 to 15% of national income  or more. The answer is to ask why this is the case in the first place, and to try and find out why it is happening in the \n",
      " There is no clear evidence that the proportion of the national income saved increases with national income per head. The most plausible explanation is that people save more because they have more to save. Practically all saving is done by people who receive profits for rents. Workers’ savings are very small. The middle-classes save a little, but in practically every community the savings of the middle- Classes out of their salaries are of little consequence for productive investment. In the U.K., where the habit is extremely well developed, the annual net increase in insurance funds from all classes, rich, middle, and poor is less than 1.5 per cent. of national income. It is doubtful if the wage and salary classes ever anywhere save as much as 3 per cent of thenational income, net (possible exception : Japan). If we are interested in savings, we must concentrate attention upon profits and rents. Our problem then becomes what are the circumstances in which the share of profits in the national Income increases ? The modified classical model which we are using here has the virtue of answering the question. It assumes that practically the whole benefit of capital accumulation and of technical progress goes into the surplus. But gross margins are not likely to be constant in our model, which assumes that virtually all of the benefits of capital formation are reinvested in the productive sector. The model of a technical revolution came for the British Industrial Revolution for the Industrial Revolution came relatively relatively to the British national income, and capital formation will also grow to the case. This requires that capitalist employment should expand relatively much  11   more faster than the surplus, so that within the capitalist sector gross margins or profit plus rent are falling sharply relatively to wages. We know that this does not happen. Even if gross margins were constant, profits in our models would be increasing relatively to national income in the same way that wages are constant. The central fact of economic development is that the distribution of incomes is altered in favour of the saving class. The expansion of other opportunities present more profitable outlets for investment than do technologically stagnant civilisations, and tempt capital into productive channels rather than into the building of monuments. This is the case in the case of the UK, where the top 10 per. cent. in England were not spending noticeably less on durable consumer goods in 1800 than they were in 1700. This means that more of them are employed at a wage above the subsistence earnings. The process therefore increases the capitalist surplus and the income of capitalist employees \n",
      " In our model so far capital is created only out of profits earned. In the real world, however, capitalists also create capital as a result of a net increase in the supply of money. We have now also to take account of this neo-classical capital can be created only by withdrawing resources from labour. In our model however, capital can also be created by withdrawing labour without withdrawing land and capital from other uses. 6. What causes a society to grow a capitalist class is a very difficult question, to which probably, there is no general answer. Most countries seem to begin by importing their capitalists from abroad; and in these days many (e.g. U.S.R., India) are growing a class’ of state capitalists who, for political reasons of one sort or another, are determined to create capital rapidly on public account. 7. It is hard to argue that these countries cannot afford to save more, when 40 per cent. or so of the national income is going to the top 10 per cent., and so much of rent incomes is squandered. In point of fact the inequality of income is greater in over-populated under-developed countries than it is in advanced industrial nations. The dominant classes in backward economies-landlords, moneylenders, priests, soldiers, princes-do not normally think in these terms. 8. Once a capitalist sector has emerged, it is only a matter of time before it becomes sizeable. 9. If the opportunities for using capital productivity increase rapidly, the surplus will also grow rapidly, and the capitalist class with it. 10. The inequality which goes with profits that favours capital formation, and not the inequality which went with rents, may be greater where distribution is more equal if profits are higher relatively to rents. 11. If there is zero marginal productivity of labour, and if capital is withdrawn from labour without using it, then capital can only be created without withdrawing labour and other uses of land. 12. If labour and capital are used together, then the marginal productivity is zero, and so is capital's marginal productivity and if labour is also withdrawn from the market, then it can only create capital without using scarce land or capital of any kind. 13. In this model practically the whole benefit of inventions goes into the surplus, and becomes available for further capital accumulation. 14. If we assume that these inventions raised the marginal. productivity of capital more than they raised themarginal productivity of. labour, \n",
      " In our model surplus labour cannot be used to make consumer goods without using up more land or capital. However, in practice the proviso is often fulfilled. If a community is short of capital, and has idle resources which can be set to creating capital, it seems very desirable on the face of the matter that this should be done. There is no loss of other output while the new capital is being made, and when it comes into use it will raise output and employment in just the same way as would capital financed not by credit creation but out of profits. In the neo-classical model the output of consumer goods is reduced, forcing the community as a whole to save. In our model, however, consumer goods output is not at any time reduced ; there is a forced redistribution of consumption, but not forced saving. And, of course, as soon as the capital goods begin to yield output, consumption begins to rise. This inflationary process does not go on forever; it comes to an end when voluntary savings increase to a level where they are equal to the inflated level of investment. Essentially equilibrium is secured by raising the ratio of profits to the national income. The equilibrator need not however be profits ; it might equally be government receipts. In U.S.R. the economy was being transformed from a 5 per cent net saver to a 20 per cent saver. This seems to be just about what happened to the economy in the crucial years when the U.N. was transforming from a net savers’ to a net depositor’s economy. This is one of those crucial cases where it is important to be certain that one is using the right model when it came to giving advice on economic policy. The difference between profit-financed and credit-financing capital is not in the ultimate effects on output, but in’the immediate effects on prices and on the distribution of income. It is not difficult to think of labour creating capital without using any but the simplest tools. Even in modern industrial countries constructional activity, which lends itself to hand labour, is as much as 50 or 60 per cent of gross fixed investment. In Keynesian model an increase in capital formation also increases the output  more than capital formation, and if the multiplier exceeds 2, the output is increased even more than the capital formation. This means that the inflation continues until profits increase so much relatively to national income that capitalists can now finance the higher rate \n",
      " In the U.S.R. there was a tremendous inflation of prices (apparently prices rose about 700 per cent. in a decade), but the inflationary profits largely went to the government in the form of turnover tax, and by the end of the decade a new equilibrium was in sight. It is not, however, always a simple matter to raise profits relatively to national income simply by turning on the monetary tap. In our model it is hard to get away with it at the expense of the workers, since the wage in the capitalist sector must stand at a certain minimum level above subsistence earnings if labour is to be available. We can give an exact description of this equilibrium in our modified classical model. In this model the average subsistence real income is given, and so also therefore is the real wage inthe capitalist sector. In the real world none of these classes will take this lying down. If, therefore, the capitalists begin to finance capital formation out of credit, they lower the real incomes of the others only temporarily. Wages would then be chasing prices continuously but for the fact that, since output is growing all the time, profits are growing all of the time. By the time the process of recontracting has begun; output has also begun to rise, and it is therefore possible to reach a modus vivendi. All that is required is that capitalists’ real incomes rise faster than other people’s. This is not possible for another reason, namely that the real national income is not fixed, but rising, as a result of the capital formation. It seems impossible for profits to rise relatively to the national income for more than a temporary space.

      " Inflation for purposes of capital formation is self-destructive. Prices begin to rise, but are sooner or later overtaken by rising output. The new equilibrium, however, may take a long time to reach. This is the most important practical limitation on the extent to which capital formation can be financed in this way. Bank credit moves three steps up and one step down instead of moving up continuously. If capital were hoarding, capital formation would proceed steadily. It is mainly financed out of profits, and if there were no hoarding there would also be no capital formation. This brings us down instead to the threshold of moving down. We have seen that if new money is used to finance capital formation the rise of prices eventually peters out, as savings grow into equilibrium with investment. This reverses itself, as the output of consumer goods begins to pour out. It may become necessary to call a drastic halt. We may now sum up this section. We are now at the end of the first part of our series of articles on the state of the British economy. We hope that this will help you to understand the current state of our economy and the prospects for the future. The second part of the series will look at the effects of credit creation on prices. The third and final part will be on the economy in the UK and the rest of the world. The fourth and final section will be about the world and the role of the Bank of England in the economy. The final part of this series will be a discussion of the impact of the UK’s financial crisis on the global economy and its impact on the world economy. It will also look at some of the implications of the crisis for the UK, and for the world as a whole. The last section will focus on the effects on the UK of the European financial crisis and on the implications for the US of the Eurozone and the world of the eurozone in the long-term. We will end the series with a look at how the UK has been affected by the crisis and the impact it has had on the eurozone and the UK in the short-term, as well as the implications on the future of the EU and the US for the Euro. The first section of the article is a summary of the Keynesian formula for a demand inflation, and the second is a discussion on the impact on prices of credit created by credit creation. The Keynesian model assumes that money income will rise to an equilibrium level of \n",
      " In an open economy inflation plays havoc with the balance of payments. We have to assume that the government has strict control over foreign transactions. The larger the government’s share of marginal incomes, the more it will get back, and the smaller will be the effect on prices. No government should consider deficit financing without assuring itself that a large part of increases in money will automatically come back. By contrast, the U.S.R., with its high rate of turnover tax, automatically mops up surplus funds injected into the system, before they are able to generate inflation via the multiplier. The next question is the effect of inflation upon the various classes. What effect does inflation have upon the different classes? And (3) What effect has government capital formation upon output? The results lie within two extremes. At one extreme all the money spent by the government comes back to it in taxes, and this is accepted by all classes. At the other extreme, all classes refuse to accept a redistribution between themselves and the government. In this case prices tend to rise continuously, except that rising output (as a result of the capital formed) sooner or later catches up with prices and brings them down again. The best placed governments from this point of view are those in countries where output is concentrated in a few large units (mines, plantations) or where foreign trade is a large parts of the national income, and is thus easily reached by import and export duties. One of the worst off is India, with a large. part of its output produced by subsistence producers and small scale units, hard to reach, and with less than ten per cent. of national income passing in foreign trade. This is one of the major reasons why their price levels have not risen more, despite heavy pressure on resources for capital formation, defence, etc. In backward countries, however, governments take only a very small part ofmarginal incomes. This assumption holds for some backward economies ; others would get into an awful mess if they launched upon inflationary finance. The results give us the questions we must ask. (1). What part of marginal income returns automatically to the government? (2). What effect do inflation has upon the Various classes? (3), and (4) The effect on output of inflation-financed government formation of capital, and thereby also give ourselves the chance to recapitulate the analysis of the previous section. It is not necessary to enter into the trade cycle since in this respect \n",
      " The best thing that can happen is for the surplus money to roll into the pockets of people who will reinvest it productively. The effects of an inflation on secondary capital formation depend on how large the industrial class is. In countries which have only a small industrial class, inflation leads mainly to speculation in commodities and in land, and to the hoarding of foreign exchange. But in any country which has a substantial industrialist class, with the passion this class has for ruling over. bigger and better factories, even the most frightening inflations leave behind a substantial increase in capital formation. If the intention is to finance capital formation, the best objects are those which yield large income quickly. To finance school building by creating credit is asking for trouble. To end inflation as soon as possible, all classes should be encouraged to invest in government bonds rather than to spend in other ways. The surplus money raises prices, some more than others. The government will probably try to prevent prices from rising, but will succeed better with some than with others. It is easy to apply price control to large scale enterprises, but very hard to prevent the farmers from raising food prices, or the petty traders from making big margins. The merchant classes would probably use it mainly for speculation in those commodities that are getting scarce. The middle-classes would mainly buy big American cars with it, or go on trips to Europe, wangling the foreign exchange somehow. The peasants ought to use it to improve their farms, but probably most would use it only to pay off debt, or to buy more land. Only the industralist’s passion drives towards using profits to create a bigger empire of bricks and steel. The peasant farmer wants to have more land, not more capital on his land (unless he is a modern capitalist farmer) so his passion is dissipated merely in changes in the price and distribution of land. Inflation continues to be generated so long as the community is not willing to hold an amount equal to the increased investment expenditure. The gap is closed only if the savings are hoarded, or used to buy government bonds, so that the government can now finance its investments by borrowing, instead of by creating new money. It would be much sounder to pursue policies which would result in the profits of industrialists rising more rapidly than other incomes, and then to tax these profits away, either immediately, or at death. If it is failing to do this, the inflation will continue ; it is then better that \n",

      " In practice this is a question of the relationship between industry and agriculture. If the capitalists are investing in plantation agriculture side by side with their investment in industry, we can think of the capitalist sector as self-contained. The expansion of this sector does not then generate any demand for anything produced in the subsistence sector. This is one of the senses in which industrialisation is dependent upon agricultural improvement. It is not profitable to produce a growing volume of manufactures unless agricultural production is growing simultaneously. In Japan this was achieved by raising rents against the farmers, and by taxing them more heavily, so that a large part of the rapid increase in productivity which occurred (between 1880 and 1910 it doubled) was taken away from the farmers and used for capital formation. Much the same happened in the U.S.R., where farm incomes per head were held down, in spite of farm mechanisation and the considerable release of labour to the towns. This also defines for us the case in which it is true to say that it is agriculture which finances industrialisation. By contrast a state which is ruled by peasants may be happy and prosperous, but it is not likely to show a rapid accumulation of capital. (E.g., will China and the US.R. diverge in this respect, in the respect of capital? We conclude that the expansion of thecapitalist sector may be stopped because the price of subsistence goods rises, or not as fast as the subsistence price falls. This assumes that the capitalist and subsistence sectors are producing different things. In practice, however, this is not the case, and it is more likely to be the case that they are producing the same thing, but at different levels of production. We conclude, therefore, that the Expansion of the Capitalist Sector is in no way dependent upon the peasants. The surplus is wholly “at the expense” of the workers in the capitalistsector. But if the capitalists depend on the peasants for food, it is essential to get the peasants to produce more, while if at the same time they can be prevented from enjoying the full fruit of their extra production, wages can be reduced relatively to the capitalist surplus. In this case, we conclude that industrialisation can only happen if the peasants produce more and more, and the capitalists produce less and less of their own food. This leads to the conclusion that agriculture is the key to industrialisation, and that it should be the main source of wealth and power. We therefore conclude that it must \n",
      " In the classical world all countries have surplus labour, but in the neo-classical world labour is scarce in all countries. In the real world, countries which achieve labour scarcity continue to be surrounded by others which have abundant labour. When capital accumulation catches up with the labour supply, wages begin to rise above the subsistence level, and the capitalist surplus is adversely affected. If there is still surplus labour in other countries, the capitalists can avoid this in one of two ways, by encouraging immigration or by exporting their capital to countries where there are still abundant labour at a subsistence wage. We must examine each of these in turn. We cannot say that capital will always grow faster than labour (it obviously has not done so in Asia), but we can say that if conditions are favourable for thecapitalist surplus to grow more rapidly than population, there must come a day when capital accumulation has caught up with labour supply. If none of these processes is enough to stop capital accumulation, the capitalist sector will continue to expand until there is no surplus labour left. This can happen even if population is growing. For example, if it takes 3 per cent. of annual income invested to employ 1 per cent more people, an annual net investment of 12 per cent can cope with as much as a 4 per cent increase in population. But population in Western Europe at the relevant times grew only by 1% or so per annum (which is also the present rate of growth in India), and rates of growth exceeding 2J per cent per year are even now rather rare. If 100,000 Puerto Ricans emigrate to the United States every year, the effect on U.S. wages is negligible. U.s. wages are not pulled down to the Puerto Rican level ; it is then pulled up to the U.K. level. Mass immigration is quite different. In a competitive model the Indian and Chinese wage levels would certainly be pulled down towards the Chinese levels in a competitive business model. In fact, if there were free immigration from India and China to the US., the wage level of the US.A. would be the same as in the Chinese and Indian countries. It is theoretically possible that the immigration of skilled workers may reduce the demand for the services of native unskilled workers, but this is most unlikely. More probably it will make possible new investments and industries which were not possible before, and will thus increase theDemand for all kinds of labour, relatively to its supply. We will not pursue \n",
      " Wages are constant at subsistence level plus. All the benefit of increasing returns goes into the capitalist surplus. U.S. wage could exceed the Asian wage only by an amount covering migration costs plus the ‘cliff’ to which we have already referred. The effect of exporting capital is to reduce the creation of fixed capital at home, and therefore to reduce demand for labour. This is one of the reasons why, in every country where the wage level is relatively high, the trade unions are bitterly hostile to immigration, except of people in special categories. The result is that real wages are higher than they would otherwise be, while profits, capital resources, and total output are smaller than they will otherwise be. The most productive investments are those which are made to open up rich, easily accessible natural resources, such as fertile soil, ores, coal or oil. In the well developed parts of the world the main opportunity for’ productive investment lies in improving techniques. These countries are well (even over-) developed in the resource sense, but under-developed in their techniques. It is profitable to use capital to introduce new techniques, but this is not as profitable as using capital to make available both new techniques and also new resources. This also explains why the United Kingdom rapidly became a capital exporting country (the limits of its natural resources were soon reached) whereas the United States is very late in reaching this stage, since its natural. resources are so extensive that capital investment at home is still very profitable even though wages are very high. But not all. investment in B depends not only upon the human. resources, but also upon the efficiency of all other industries whose services the new investment would use. This depends partly upon how highly highly capitalised these industries would be, and partly upon the way they are used. For example, the productivity of investment in. B depends on not only its human resources but also its human institutions, but on how highly capitalise they would be. It cannot be taken for granted that it will be more profitable to invest in B if profits are falling in A. Productivity depends also on the human material. Even though the genetic composition of peoples may be much the same, as far as potential productivity may be concerned, their cultural inheritance is very different. Differences in literacy, forms of government, attitudes to work, and social relations generally may make a big difference to productivity. The export of capital is therefore a much easier way out for the capitalists, \n",
      " The productivity of one investment depends upon other investments having been made before. It may be more profitable to invest capital in countries which already have a lot of capital than to invest it in a new country. If we could assume that there is a natural tendency for the rate of profit to fall in a closed economy, we could say that the rate in the closed economy must ultimately fall towards the level elsewhere, after which capital export must begin. But in practice capital export is small, and the gap does widen. We must therefore beware of saying that a country will begin to export capital as soon as capital accumulation at home catches up with labour supply. What brings about the exportation of capital is not inevitably falling home profits, or rising wages at home, but simply the fact that foreign countries having different resources unutilised in different degrees there are some profitable opportunities for investment abroad. This is not even dependent on capital accumulation having caught up with surplus labour at home. Many capitalists residing in surplus labour countries invest their capital in England or the United States. We can say that if labour is scarce in those countries, the effect is to reduce the demand for labour in those country and thus to prevent wages from rising as much as they otherwise would. The yield may fall or it may not; we cannot foretell. We get a different answer, however, if we turn from the rates of profit on capital in general to the rates in particular lines of investment. It is open to them to put their accumulating profits into quite different industries. But there is also the temptation to stick to the field in which they have specialised knowledge, and to use their profits to take the industry into new countries. In the second case, each country produces two or more goods, one of which is common to both, and is the good produced in the subsistence sector. Here wage levels are not determined in relation to each other. Relative prices are determined solely by supply and demand. If the capitalist techniques which fified wheat production are applicable to peanuts, it will pay to exported capital to B, where unlimited labour is available at a wage related to average output of peanuts. As in the first case, wages in A will be held down by the profitability of investing capital in B. Other industries are. other industries are equally equally important, and so the productivity of a particular line of investment will be limited or greatly reduced. In due course, the surplus labour in wheat is eliminated and wheat wages start to rise. But the \n",
      " When capital is being invested in A, and raising the output of wheat, the price of peanuts will rise relatively. When capital is invested in B the opposite happens : the terms of trade are moved against the B workers in favour of the A workers. The moral is that capital export may benefit the workers on balance if it is applied to increasing the supply of things they import. For example, in the Britain of 1850 exclusive investment at home in the cotton industry, while tending to raise wages, might also still more have depressed the Terms of Trade against the Cotton industry. We have here the key to the question why tropical produce is so cheap. The reason is that wages in the sugar industry are related to the fact that the subsistence sectors of tropical economies are able to release however many workers the Sugar industry may want, at wages which are low. However vastly productive the. sugar industry may become, the benefit accrues chiefly to industrial purchasers in the form of lower prices for sugar. To raise the. price of sugar you must increase the productivity of the tropical food economies. Now the contribution of the temperate world in capital or in the main been 25    export, where the benefit is mainly confined to the commercial crops for export. The benefit of this is mainly accruing to the temperates of the commercial world for export, and this is why the prices of these crops are so low. The benefits of this are largely due to the low production costs in the tropical world, and the low labour costs of producing these crops in the tropics, which are much higher than in the rest of the world. This is the reason why workers in sugar continue to walk barefooted and to live in shacks, while workers in wheat enjoy among the highest living standards in the world-certainly not by the wheat industry. It is also the reason that workers in the Sugar Industry have about trebled over the course of the last 75 years, a rate of growth of productivity which is unparalled by any other major industry in the. world. In the sugar Industry, workers are paid far less than those in the Food Industry, which has a much higher rate of productivity than the Food industry. The difference in wages between the two is the difference in the difference between the wages of capitalist and subsistence workers in A and B. In both cases, the wage cannot fall below productivity in the food industry. If on the other hand the subsistence economy became more productive, wages would \n",
      " The analysis applies to all tropical commercial products of which an unlimited supply can be produced because unlimited natural resources exist. It does not apply where natural resources of a particular kind are scarce. tropical commercial crops will always permit only subsistence wages until, for a change, capital and knowledge are put at the disposal of the subsistence producers to increase the productivity of tropical food production for home consumption. This divergence between the actual and what it ought to be is the most serious difference which the existence of surplus labour makes to the neo-classical theory of international trade. It has caught out many economists, who have wrongly advised under-developed countries on the basis of current money costs, instead of lifting the veil to see what lies beneath. The fault is not that of the Law of Comparative Costs, which remains valid if written in real marginal terms, but of those who have forgotten that money costs are entirely misleading in economies where there is surplus labour at a free wage. In practice, wages will be 2 food in B and between 3 food and 6 food in A, at which levels it will be “cheaper” for B to export food and import cotton. The whole benefit of increasing product v ty in the commercial sector goes to the foreign consumer, at least in the ear y s ages.  26    The comparison has to be made not in terms of labour cost of the scarce resource, such as land or land of suitable quality. Of course if two countries can produce the same things, and trade with each other, we can assume that these coincide in A and also in cotton manufacture in B. Then we should write, in marginal terms,. in A produces 3 food or 3 cotton manufactures in B “ 0“ or 1 “ B should specialise in cottonmanufacturing and import food. We should assume that in A production of food and cotton manufacturing in B is equivalent to 1 day’s labour in A or 2 days labour in B 2 „ or 1’ or 2 “ or 3 “ in the next case we assume that the two countries are the same, and that they can produce same things. We can write that one day of labour in a country where labour is scarce, B the country where unlimited labour is available in the subsistence (food) sector. This is the only case (a doubtful one) where it seems that a world scarcity of suitable land may now permanently bring to the peasants earnings higher than they could obtain from \n",
      " Even though labour is unemployed, it may be more economic to use capital to increase the production of food than to use it in creating new manufacturing industries. Adam Smith was as usual on the ball; this was the substance of his argument that a tariff could not raise the national income even if it increased employment. Many manufacturing activities do not in fact use any other scarce resource but labour. The handicraft and cottage industries especially, which may provide employment for up to ten per cent. of the people in backward countries, use no capital resources to speak of. Yet these are the very first industries to be destroyed by cheap imports of manufactures (e.g. the havoc wrought to the Indian cotton industry in the first half of the nineteenth century). The Law of Comparative Costs, rightly applied, enables us to predict the pattern of international trade. We can say that those countries which have inadequate agricultural resources in relation to their populations must live by importing agricultural products and exporting manufactures. If world population continues to grow at its current rate, this pattern must emerge in due course, unless there are revolutionary developments in agricultural science. If the world capitalist sector is not dependent on the peasants for food, even to feed its plantation and mining labourers in the surplus countries, an increase in the productivity of the peasants must raise wages against the capitalists. To have this effect, however, productivity must rise in all these countries, otherwise the capitalists will simply transfer from those countries where subsistence productivity has risen to those where it has not. If we assume that the capitalists need the peasants’ food, and that the increased demand for food is inelastic, then increased productivity reduces the price of food even and so reduces the share of the capitalist product. This assumes that the changes are world-wide; if one country raises its productivity, and wages will rise in that country, and capitalists will move elsewhere. But if the price falls, even if the prices of food falls, the peasants eat most of their peasants' food and so reduce the market share of capitalist workers. This again assumes the changes in the world economy are worldwide; and if the world- wide changes in productivity will not fall, the wages of workers will not rise; and so the capitalist share in the market will fall. This is the same as we made for the closed economy (section 8), except that we must now think of the world as a whole as the closedEconomy. We must also think of these economies as being a part \n",
      " Food production in tropical countries with surplus labour is only a small part of world food production (Asia and Africa together produce less than 20 per cent. of the world’s food). Hence increases in food productivity in the tropics could not reduce the price of food Pari passu. Real wages would therefore rise, and the terms of trade would move in favour of tropical commercial products. This would hurt labour in the industrial countries in so far as it was buying such products, and benefit tropical countries competing in industrial production. We may conclude as follows. Capital export tends to reduce wages in capital exporting countries. This is wholly or partly offset if the capital is applied to cheapening the things which the workers import, or to raising wage costs in  28  countries which compete in third markets (by raising productivity in their subsistence sectors). The reduction in wages is however aggravated if capital is invested in ways which raise the cost of imports (by increasing productivity in subsistence sectors) or which increase the productivity of competing exports. ‘The neo-classical model (including the Keynesian) when applied to such economies gives erroneous results.’ ‘Capital formation and technical progress result not in raising wages, but in raising the share of profits in the national income.‘ ‘‘The reason why savings are low in an undeveloped economy relatively to national income is not that the people are poor, but that capitalist profits are low relatively toNational income. As the capitalist sector expands, profits grow relatively, and an increasing proportion of national income are re-invested.” ‘Inflation for the purpose of getting hold of resources may be respectable for war, but it is self-destructive as the rise in prices rises and falls again as its output reaches the market.  ‘. The real cost of capital created by inflation is zero in this model, and this capital is just as useful as what is created in more fashion (i.e. out of profits) out of credit creation.   “The capitalist sector cannot expand indefinitely, since capital accumulation can only expand in these ways indefinitely. ” “. In many economies an unlimited supply of labour is available at a subsistence wage. This was the classical model. In such an economy employment expands in a capitalist sector as capital formation occurs. ‚  In most but not all of these sectors, if the country is overpopulated relatively to its natural resources, the \n",
      " When the surplus is exhausted, wages begin to rise above the subsistence level. The export of capital reduces capital formation at home, and so keeps wages down. Practically all the benefit of increasing efficiency in export industries goes to the foreign consumer. The Law of Comparative Costs is just as valid in countries with surplus labour as it is in others. But whereas in the latter it is a valid foundation of arguments for free trade, in the former it is an equally valid foundation for protection. W.
